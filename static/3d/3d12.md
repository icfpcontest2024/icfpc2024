# Input
  `-1570796327 <= A <= 1570796327`

# Output
  `truncate(sin(A / 1_000_000_000) * 1_000_000_000)`,

In other words, `sin(A radians)`,
where the input and the output are expressed
in the fixed-point representation with the scaling factor 10^9.

The output may differ from the correct value by 1.

# Tips

* It's probably useful to use the Taylor series representation
  of the sine function.

* Adapting Horner's method to evaluate the series may be useful, too.
